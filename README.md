## 💻 Technologies Used

This project was built using:

- **HTML5** – for semantic structure of the app  
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – for handling user input and calculations

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User inputs their **Date of Birth** and the **Current Date**.
2. On clicking the **Calculate** button:
   - The script calculates the total difference between the two dates.
   - It displays:
     - Age in **years, months, days**
     - Age in **weeks, hours, minutes, and seconds**
     - Remaining days until the next birthday

All outputs are dynamically generated using JavaScript.
